Contains data extracted from EJBCA.

PKCS#12 password is "foo123"

Sample decryption:

  content = read_fixture('ejbca/ca/management_ca/keystore.p12.b64')
  decoded = Base64.decode64(content)
  p12     = OpenSSL::PKCS12.new(decoded, 'foo123')
  puts p12.key

One-liner:

  OpenSSL::PKCS12.new(Base64.decode64(read_fixture('ejbca/ca/management_ca/keystore.p12.b64')), 'foo123')
